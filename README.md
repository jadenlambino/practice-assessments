# Practice assessments!
The first week of practice assessments are unfortunately done in the app academy online editor so I can't really put them into this repo for you, I'll add the other practice assessments for the other mods as you go through the course so you can have a heads up on what to expect. 
# Instructions for using the practice assessments:
* clone this repository and run
_rm -f .git_
in order to remove the existing git file 
* cd into the pracitce assessment you would like to work on and run 
_npm install_
to install dependencies 
* in order to run the unit test use 
_mocha_ inside of the terminal
### let me know if you need any help throughout the course and make sure to make use of the ta's
